Event Handling In MVC: Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

Module controller.js
controlRecipes()
init() - Program starts


Class RecipeView
addHandlerRender() - User clicks search result


* Events should be handled in the controller (otherwise we would have application logic in the view)
* Events should be listened for in the view (otherwise we would need DOM elements in the controller)

* Publisher - Code that knows when to react - addHandlerRender()
* Subscriber - Code that wants to react - controlRecipes()

Solution to the Problem:
* Subscribe to publisher by passing in the subscriber function. 
* controlRecipes will be passed into addHandlerRender() when program starts.
* addHandlerRender() listens for events (addEventListener), and uses controlRecipes as callback
